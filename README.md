The Astro-Matrix project is an easy-to-use tool designed to help scientists find new exoplanets faster.

The main problem is that when telescopes like Kepler watch stars, they get swamped with noise and false alarms. We built a machine learning system—a Hybrid AI—that acts like a superb filter.

Instead of looking at the raw telescope data, our system focuses on eight key measurements, such as how steady the star is and how perfectly timed the planet signal is. This method makes our predictions quick, reliable, and easy to understand. The entire system is packaged into a simple, interactive Streamlit web app, making it ready to help astronomers quickly check new discoveries from large space missions.
